Hi, I'm Dominique! ðŸ‘‹ a cyber/information security specialist and researcher, hacker and enthusiast with over seven years of experience. Passionate about red teaming, assessing security risks, post-exploitation research, and ethically "doing criminal activities on purpose".

Currently providing offensive security assessments/penetration testing services at Cegeka.

Native Dutch speaker, and near-native English both spoken and written. Open to new opportunities; remote or otherwise. Will hack for food. Not interested in software engineering positions, or taking aptitude tests. Assess my performance instead.
